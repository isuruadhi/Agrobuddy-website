          In this research mainly covers the agricultural practices in Sri Lanka. Our project scope mainly enfolds with
          cultivation and farming practices within SL. So,[4] a survey found in a July 2021 that three-quarters of SL
          farmers relied heavily on chemical fertilizers, while just about 10% cultivated without them. Almost all major
          crops grown in the country depend on chemical fertilizers. But SL had magnificent traditional farming and pest
          and disease control mechanism which are organic and less harmful for environment and people’s health too. But
          nowadays Whole cultivation procedures are fully based on chemical pesticides and fertilizers are frequently
          and mostly used to control crop disease. Although excess usage of those in-organic crop management techniques
          will affect human’s health and a negatively impact on environmental health hazards to farmers and other
          consumers too. Water pollution, Unnecessary Ionization on Soil, renal diseases, testicular diseases are some
          examples for them. Therefore, we suggest an additional approach to overcome those challenges which are faced
          by farmers when managing crop related diseases. For implementation of this productive solution, we tent to use
          mobile application development strategies. <br>
          In recent years, several mobile applications have been developed to address the challenges faced by farmers in
          managing crop diseases. These applications help smallholder farmers to identify crop diseases and provide
          information on their management. However, most of these applications are limited in their scope, and they only
          focus on a few crop diseases. Furthermore, the information provided by these applications may not be
          up-to-date or reliable, which can lead to incorrect diagnosis and treatment[5]. According to the image
          recognition System to identify the crop diseases on paddy fields in Sri Lanka, the agriculture sector is a
          vital part of many rural areas and the most of the people take it as their employment[6]. However, crop
          diseases are done a significant threat to food safety, and farmers are often the ones who suffer the most from
          these diseases. Manual diagnosis of crop diseases can be challenging and time-consuming, but the with the
          improvement of the image processing techniques and methods have made it possible to create autonomous
          frameworks for disease field identification. Digital image processing is expanding quickly, and it is becoming
          an essential tool for detecting plant diseases quickly and accurately. <br>
          In recent years, machine learning-based techniques have gained popularity for identifying agricultural
          diseases using user-provided symptoms. The use of user-provided symptoms for disease identification in crops
          using machine learningbased algorithms is gaining traction. The accuracy and efficiency of disease
          identification can be greatly enhanced by including user observations alongside picture analysis. In addition,
          involving farmers and other non-experts in the disease identification process can help increase their
          awareness and knowledge of crop diseases and improve their ability to manage them. Crop diseases have massive
          impact on yields and also on the economy. So crop diseases identification and suggesting traditional remedies
          for those would be much more beneficial for small farm holders without using many complex or expensive
          systems. To our knowledge, this proposed system is the first one to detect multiple diseases and verify
          disease using user-provided observation data and suggest traditional remedies for the diseased crops. In this
          research[7], Plantix Mobile App, This mobile app is the most famous app among farmers. This mobile app can
          detect multiple crop diseases. This mobile app uses image recognition and machine learning algorithms to
          identify crop diseases but there is no severity detection, verify disease based on user observation and add
          new traditional remedies to the system. In this research[8], Agrio Mobile App, This also able to identify
          multiple crop diseases using machine learning and image processing techniques but there needs to be more
          accuracy in identifying diseases in various parts of the crop like leaf stem fruit. And also there is no
          proper way to add remedies for the relevant disease. In this research[9], E- AGRO mobile app. In order to help
          farmers, make wellinformed decisions in a timely manner, this research creates an online discussion forum and
          an automated chat service known as a "Chat-Bot." Focus group discussions and interviews with farmers,
          specialists, and other stakeholders helped create a standardized set of questions. Intentions that users may
          have, instances that users provide to elaborate on a particular intention, and entities that are distinct
          items referred to by an intention were all extracted from the inquiries. An AIML-trained model was used to
          make the prediction of intent from the provided example. But they did not provide any mechanism to detect
          diseases using user provide observations. <br>
          Internationally, there is growing interest in traditional remedies for crop protection as an alternative to
          synthetic pesticides, which can have harmful effects on human health and the environment. In a study,
          traditional remedies were found to be effective in managing pests and diseases in maize crops[10]. The authors
          reported that the most commonly used remedies were neem (Azadirachta indica). which is effective in
          controlling pests such as fall armyworm and stem borer. In Sri Lanka, traditional remedies have been used for
          centuries in crop protection, and there is a wealth of knowledge on these remedies among farmers. However,
          there is a lack of organized and accessible information on these remedies, which makes it difficult for
          farmers to access and use them effectively. A study found that farmers in Sri Lanka had limited access to
          information on alternative methods of crop protection, and that there was a need for more organized and
          accessible information on traditional remedies[11]. There have been some efforts to document and promote
          traditional remedies for crop protection in Sri Lanka. For example, the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library
          of Sri Lanka (TKDL) was established 6 to document traditional knowledge in various fields, including
          agriculture. However, there is a need for more comprehensive and accessible databases that can be easily
          accessed by farmers. <br>
          Despite the availability of synthetic pesticides, traditional remedies for crop diseases have been used for
          centuries, and they are still used in many parts of the world, including Sri Lanka. For instance, in Sri
          Lanka, traditional remedies such as neem oil, turmeric, and ginger have been used to control pests and
          diseases in crops such as rice, tea, and fruits[12].However, there is a lack of organized and accessible
          information on the traditional remedies, which makes it difficult for farmers to access and use them
          effectively. For example, a study conducted in Bangladesh found that smallholder farmers lacked access to
          reliable information on crop management and relied on word-of-mouth information from fellow farmers and
          pesticide sellers[13]. Additionally, there is a lack of information on the effectiveness of these remedies in
          comparison to synthetic pesticides, which makes it challenging for farmers to decide which option to use. For
          example, a study conducted in India found that farmers who used traditional remedies had lower crop yields
          than those who used synthetic pesticides, but the traditional remedies were more cost-effective[14].
          Furthermore, there is a lack of automated mechanisms to verify the authenticity of the remedies and filter out
          non-traditional and non-organic remedies based on keywords, which can make it difficult for farmers to trust
          the information provided. For example, a study conducted in Ghana found that farmers were wary of using
          traditional remedies due to concerns about their effectiveness and safety[15].Additionally, farmers may not be
          able to distinguish between traditional remedies and other types of products that claim to be natural or
          organic but are not effective or safe.
