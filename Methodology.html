          Users upload images of diseased crops, which are then processed by a pre-trained
          Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to propose potential diseases. From the top three suggested diseases,
          users choose one for closer examination. A Chabot engages users in symptom verification, posing targeted
          questions to refine the disease identification. Subsequently, a sequential model leverages user responses to
          further confirm the disease's accuracy. Users have the option to assess disease severity by submitting
          additional images, analyzed by a separate CNN model that returns a severity percentage. Upon accurate
          identification and severity assessment, the app recommends tailored traditional remedies, drawing on a machine
          learning model informed by regional and historical effectiveness data. The user interface presents confirmed
          diseases, severity information, and recommended remedies, fostering informed decision-making. Users can
          provide feedback for ongoing enhancement, while regular model updates refine disease identification and remedy
          suggestions based on real-world interactions and agricultural insights.<br>

          <b>1. Crop Disease Detection using Images</b><br>
          A comprehensive methodology for automated plant disease identification using Convolutional Neural Networks
          (CNNs) are employed as the primary algorithm, with a single model trained for plant identification and
          separate models for disease detection in different plants. Specific datasets are curated for each plant
          category, consisting of labeled images and corresponding disease annotations. The images undergo
          preprocessing, including resizing to a standardized resolution of 150x150 pixels using the Python Imaging
          Library (PIL), ensuring uniformity in input dimensions. For plant identification, the model is loaded from the
          file in the directory using the Keras library. The loaded model predicts the plant species by passing the
          preprocessed image through the model, extracting class probabilities. The highest probability class index is
          mapped to the corresponding label, which is then outputted. <br>
          Disease identification models and class labels are loaded based on the respective plant category. Images are
          opened, resized, normalized, and processed using the loaded models. The 'predict' function generates a
          probability distribution over the disease classes, and one other function determines the index of the class
          with the highest probability. This index is utilized to retrieve the corresponding disease class label, which
          is subsequently outputted. The integration of plant identification and disease detection functionalities
          enables accurate plant classification and disease identification. This methodology holds substantial potential
          for effective plant monitoring and management, facilitating early disease detection and informing appropriate
          agricultural practices to mitigate the impact of plant diseases on crop yield and quality.

          <b>2. Disease Verification using ML</b><br>
          The primary dataset is sourced from a JSON file containing disease observation data, encompassing disease
          names and their corresponding sequences of observations. After data collection, a preprocessing stage is
          conducted, generating diverse permutations of observation sequences to capture various behavior combinations,
          guided by the option to enable sequence learning. Model configuration entails defining critical parameters
          like vocabulary size, embedding dimensions, and maximum sequence length, along with factors such as an
          out-of-vocabulary token and the number of training epochs. The dataset is divided into training and testing
          subsets, with labels transformed into numerical representations using label encoders for consistent
          interpretation by the model. Textual data is transformed into a numeric format through tokenization, followed
          by the creation of padded sequences to ensure uniformity in length. The model architecture involves an
          embedding layer converting words into dense vectors, followed by global average pooling and dense layers with
          ReLU activation for pattern recognition. An output layer using softmax activation predicts disease categories.
          Training is executed on the training dataset, while evaluation occurs on a separate test dataset to measure
          loss and accuracy. The training process is visually represented through line plots illustrating training loss
          and accuracy, enhanced by moving averages. This structured methodology guides the systematic development of
          the disease tracing ML model, covering data processing, model configuration, training, evaluation, and
          visualization, ensuring the model's proficiency in predicting disease categories based on observation
          sequences.

          <b>3. Severitiy Level detection of identified crop disease</b><br>
          In this study, methodology for classifying plant diseases into severity levels using Convolutional Neural
          Networks (CNNs). This methodology circumscribes with testing and training as main procedures of this research
          component. In the earlier steps after identifying plant and disease according to previous components, severity
          will categorize into three distinct level such as 10%, 50% and over 90% damage. CNNs are especially
          well-suited for tasks that involve extracting spatial patterns and features from images. CNN models exhibited
          a remarkable ability to accurately predict and differentiate the extent of crops deterioration. Image
          pre-processing, encompassing normalization and resizing techniques are comparatively used to made up the
          diverse dataset for predict severity level of diseased crops. Although our field-based survey and expertise
          advices and findings are also enormously valuable when processing the dataset. In the pre-processed dataset it
          comprises images for each plant type and severity level for enhance the effectiveness for model training and
          evaluation stages.

          <b>4. Traditional Remedies suggestion for diseased crops</b><br>
          This section outlines the systematic methodology employed to develop and validate the Traditional Remedies
          Suggestion System for Diseased Crops
          The primary foundation of this research involved a comprehensive data collection process. In-depth
          consultations were conducted with seasoned agriculture experts and local farmers. Through these interactions,
          valuable insights were acquired regarding traditional remedies that have stood the test of time in addressing
          diverse crop diseases. We then organized the gathered information carefully. We put things into categories
          like where the farms are, what types of plants are grown, what diseases affect the crops, and how severe the
          problems are. This organization streamlined data storage and established a framework for subsequent analysis.
          To ensure the universal applicability of the chosen grading system, we checked them against information from
          various geographical regions. This was important to make sure our system would accommodate well for different
          types of farming landscapes.<br>
          The heart of our research was the creation of a strong neural network model. By utilizing the Keras library,
          we meticulously designed the architecture of this model, using multiple layers, each with unique functions
          like ReLU and Softmax activation functions. This model was tailored to accurately predict the effectiveness of
          different remedies based on the input factors provided. The neural network model underwent intensive training,
          a critical phase of its development. This training process involved using a carefully prepared dataset and
          optimizing the model's performance through techniques like the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical
          cross-entropy loss function. The model was fine-tuned to achieve the best possible predictive performance.
          We evaluated the model's effectiveness through rigorous testing using an independent dataset. Metrics such as
          accuracy and other relevant indicators were used to measure the model's ability to provide precise suggestions
          for traditional remedies across a wide range of diverse crop disease scenarios. The effectiveness of our
          Traditional Remedies Suggestion System was thoroughly assessed by analyzing its accuracy and other relevant
          evaluation metrics. This assessment offered a comprehensive understanding of the system's capability to
          provide practical and relevant traditional remedy recommendations tailored to different crop disease
          situations.<br>
          In conclusion, our research methodology underscores the main goal of the Traditional Remedies Suggestion
          System: to equip farmers with effective and practical traditional remedy suggestions. Through this system, we
          aim to empower farmers to adapt their agricultural practices to effectively address the dynamic challenges
          posed by various crop diseases.
