        <h3>Sub Objectives - Sahan Ranathunga</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Develop a dataset that includes images of diseased fruits and stems for training and validation purposes.
          </li>
          <li>Investigate and compare different image processing and machine learning techniques for detecting diseases
            in fruits and stems.</li>
          <li>Develop an accurate and efficient method for detecting diseases in fruits and stems that can be used by
            farmers and agricultural researchers.</li>
          <li>Test the proposed method on different crops and in different environmental conditions to evaluate its
            performance and robustness.</li>

        <h3>Sub Objectives - Pasindu Dasanayake</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Develop a standardized approach for collecting farmer or expert knowledge related to plant disease,
            including symptoms, environmental factors, and other relevant information.</li>
          <li>Design a system for gathering observation data using a chatbot and verifying the disease by analyzing it
            using Machine learning.</li>
          <li>Identify any limitations or challenges associated with using farmer or expert knowledge for plant disease
            verification and propose solutions for addressing them.</li>

        <h3>Sub Objectives - Damith Wijayakumara</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Develop an image processing technique that can accurately detect and segment diseased regions in all parts
            of the plant, including leaves, fruit, and stem.</li>
          <li>Develop a machine learning model that can predict disease severity based on extracted features from all
            parts of the plant.</li>
          <li>Evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with existing methods for disease severity
            prediction in all parts of the plant.</li>
          <li>Evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with existing methods for disease severity
            prediction in all parts of the plant.</li>
          <li>Provide recommendations on the implementation of the proposed method in real-world settings to help
            farmers make informed decisions about disease control strategies.</li>
