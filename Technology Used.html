          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Android Studio</strong> - Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE)
            for Android app development, and it's widely used by developers to create Android applications.
            <ul>
              <li>IDE for Android: Android Studio is specifically designed for developing Android apps. It provides a
                comprehensive set of tools and features tailored to the Android platform.</li>
              <li>Developing in Java/Kotlin: Android Studio supports Java and Kotlin as the primary programming
                languages for Android app development. Kotlin, in particular, has gained popularity as a more concise
                and expressive language for Android development.</li>

            <strong>Flask</strong> - Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework for building web applications in
            Python.
            <ul>
              <li>Micro Framework: Flask is often referred to as a "micro" web framework because it provides the
                essentials for building web applications without imposing a lot of pre-defined structure or
                dependencies. This gives developers the flexibility to choose their components and libraries.</li>
              <li>Minimalistic: Flask's core is minimalistic, offering only the basic tools needed for web development,
                such as routing, request handling, and response generation. Additional functionality can be added
                through Flask extensions and third-party libraries.</li>
              <li>RESTful Design: Flask is well-suited for building RESTful APIs. Its routing system, combined with HTTP
                methods, makes it easy to create API endpoints for handling HTTP requests.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>Single Codebase: One of the primary advantages of Flutter is the ability to write a single codebase
                that can be used to create applications for multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, web, and
                desktop.</li>
              <li>Dart Programming Language: Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is also developed by
                Google. Dart is known for its high-performance just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation,
                making it efficient for mobile app development.</li>
              <li>Hot Reload: Flutter's "hot reload" feature allows developers to see changes in their code reflected in
                the app immediately, without restarting the entire application. This speeds up the development and
                debugging process.</li>
            </ul>
